# CAPCORE-python: a collection of functions I use here and there

After 3 projects, I have decided to build a collection of functions that usually go on the libs.misc

Functions are to solve my itches doing the things the way I like to do them. So you can expect Spanglish and a lot of inconsistencies. 

Also, I am not very happy with the naming conventions -snake naming and case rules- so you probably shouldn't expect them.


## How to use it

Add the following line to your requirements:

~~~
git+https://github.com/cesaralba/CAPcore-python@develop
~~~

You may want to replace the branch name -currently _develop_- with whichever 
reference you want to use
