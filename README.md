# CAPCORE-python: a collection of functions I use here and there

After 3 projects, I have decided to build a collection of functions that usually go on the libs.misc

Functions are to solve my itches doing the things the way I like to do them. So you can expect Spanglish and a lot of inconsistencies. 

Also, I am not very happy with the naming conventions -snake naming and case rules- so you probably shouldn't expect them.
